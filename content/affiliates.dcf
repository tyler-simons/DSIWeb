His research is focused on statistical analysis and machine learning models that can accurately predict the pavement condition with time. This is essential for optimizing the timing of system maintenance and minimizing system management costs. Ashkan is interested in statistical modeling and machine learning for data-driven decision making and optimization. He is also open to research projects in other fields to diversify his experience.

title: Developing genomic prediction software for plant breeding.
desc: Soné is implementing statistical models to forecast the best cross for superior progeny phenotypes for Brassica and, ideally, other plant species. She is also working to isolate genotype by environment predictors to inform plant breeders which of their existing plants could be bred to produce progeny that flourish outside of the normal environment. She works mainly in R and with some Python and is interested in increasing her forecasting and database skills.

title: Food, flavor, and consumer preferences
desc: Tyler's background includes experience in chemistry, culinary science, and sensory analysis. He evaluates metabolomic, flavoromic, and tasting data together to understand chemical and sensory drivers of liking for consumer preferences. He uses mainly R and Shiny for data analysis, NLP, and data distribution but is interested in learning Python and SQL to improve his workflow efficiency. More than anything he wants to know which foods are delicious and where he can eat them.

location: Integrative Genetics & Genomics
title: Evolutionary history of conifers.
desc: Working on the largest genome sequences to-date, Lida is interested in recreating the evolutionary histories of conifer species using population genomics and demographic inference models (such as Markov Chain Coalescent models). She uses population genetic statistics, probability, and stochastic theory for analysis of large data structures (i.e., genomic DNA data) in Python, R, Perl, C++, and Unix/bash. Lida would like learn more about coding efficiency (unit-testing, other tips & tricks, etc.), handling of big data structures in R, Python, Perl, and C++, and machine learning.
